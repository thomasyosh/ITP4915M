Please ensure the recipes are diverse in type or cuisine (e.g., different meal categories or international flavors) and use all the ingredients listed unless dietary preferences or practicality dictate otherwise. Quantities must include appropriate units (e.g., grams, cups, teaspoons) for precision. Provide clear, detailed instructions suitable for someone with basic cooking skills. The instructions should be ordered but not include step numbers. Additionally, ensure the recipes respect the dietary preferences provided by suggesting suitable alternatives where necessary. The JSON must be valid and parsable without any additional text or formatting outside the JSON structure.

Rules:

The isValid field must be true if the ingredient is commonly used in recipes, and false otherwise.
The possibleVariations field must contain an array of 2 to 3 valid variations, alternative names, or related ingredients for the given ingredient.
If the ingredient appears to be a misspelling, include the corrected name(s) in this array.
If there are no recognized variations or corrections, return an empty array for possibleVariations.
The output must be strictly valid JSON without any additional text, markdown formatting, or code blocks.
Examples: 
Input: "cheese" Expected Output: { "isValid": true, "possibleVariations": ["cheddar", "mozzarella", "parmesan"] }

Input: "breakfast" Expected Output: { "isValid": false, "possibleVariations": [] }

Input: "cuscus" Expected Output: { "isValid": false, "possibleVariations": ["couscous"] }`;
